                        you withdraw your consent to consent based processing and no other legal justification for processing applies;
                        you object to processing for direct marketing purposes;
                        we unlawfully processed your personal information; and
                        erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.
                        We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is necessary for:
                        Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
                        Complying with a legal obligation under EU or other applicable law;
                        The performance of a task carried out in the public interest;
                        Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, under certain circumstances; and/or
                        The establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.

                        Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing
                        You have a right to restrict processing of your personal information, such as where:

                        you contest the accuracy of the personal information;
                        where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of the unlawfully processed personal information;
                        we no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.

                        You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the services we can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.

                        Right to data portability
                        Where the legal basis for our processing is your consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, you have a right to receive the personal information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or ask us to send it to another person.

                        Right to freedom from automated decision-making
                        As explained above, we do not use automated decision-making, but where any automated decision-making takes place, you have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision, as well as request that decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based on your personal data are made by natural persons, not only by computers.

                        Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)
                        You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us.
                        We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless:

                        you have a business relationship with us, and we rely on our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing (as described above)
                        you have otherwise given your prior consent (such as when you download one of our guides)

                        You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us on the above details. On each and every marketing communication, we will always provide the option for you to exercise your right to object to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes (known as ‘opting-out’) by clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ button on our marketing emails or choosing a similar opt-out option on any forms we use to collect your data. You may also opt-out at any time by contacting us on the below details.

                        Please note that any administrative or service-related communications (to offer our services, or notify you of an update to this Privacy Policy or applicable terms of business, etc.) will solely be directed at our clients or business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the services requested. Therefore, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our website or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.

                        Right to request access
                        You also have a right to access information we hold about you. We are happy to provide you with details of your Personal Information that we hold or process. To protect your personal information, we follow set storage and disclosure procedures, which mean that we will require proof of identity from you prior to disclosing such information.

                        Right to withdraw consent
                        Where the legal basis for processing your personal information is your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us on the above details.

                        Raising a complaint about how we have handled your personal data
